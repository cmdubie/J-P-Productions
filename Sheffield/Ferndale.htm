      medieval, fantasy or renaissance role playing eras. Ferndale welcomes visitors, 
      business owners, gamers, fun seekers, and everyone to explore this cool 
      place! Ferndale consists of a limited number of rent buildings. We do not 
      offer parcels or land, but instead, we offer pre-fab building spaces. You 
      are not allowed to rez your own house, or any large structure on the desired 
      space. If you do, it will be returned to you with in 24 hours. Each building 
      will have different set prim allotments. You may rez furniture and/or business 
      items as you see fit, but please try to keep your rezzed items to as close 
      as the theme as possible. (Medieval) Ugly, garish items, either in your 
      yard, business, and/or extended from your house will get a warning for removal. 
      Please do not attempt to alter or delete any prefab prim items already existing 
      in your rental parcel.</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font color="#EDDF94" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Permissible 
      Products - Feel free to sell anything inside the buildings you are renting. 
      However, Please do not sell any of the following items; griefing items or 
      other things that can cause harm to sims, other avatars, or prims. Also, 
      please no sex related items that contain under age persons, either real 
      life or Second Life in nature. If you are selling sexually explicit material, 
      please be tasteful and do not rez out pictures of sexual acts, either real 
      or pixel. Please try to keep to the theme of this parcel - Medieval, in 
      both products and decorations. Thank you.</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font color="#EDDF94" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">About 
      Vendors - You only have 50 prims to display your wares. Our recommendation 
      is to use the available ONE PRIM vendors that are found on Marketstreet 
      or in shops in-world. Try to find low prim displays and vendors that are 
      running 1-2 scripts. There are many and inexpensive too.</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font color="#EDDF94" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Lag 
      - To keep this sim as a low-lag sim, please keep your guest count in private 
      homes to less than 5 avatars. Business locations will have a limit of 20 
      people per business, per hour. When lag becomes unusually severe, we will 
      res-set the sim, so be prepared to move to another location when this occurs. 
      Re-sets last approximately 2 minutes.</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font color="#EDDF94" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Prims 
      - Please do not go over your allocated prim limit. To check how many prims 
      you have rezzed, please check your rent box, which will keep track of everything 
      you bring into the parcel. If you go over your prim limit, you will be warned. 
      If you do not reduce the prim count within 24 hours, the Ferndale owners 
      will return items to you that they see fit. MAKE SURE YOU ARE WEARING THE 
      GROUP TAG WHEN REZZING! Anything rezzed under the wrong tag will be returned 
      after 5 minutes. Continuous problems with the above will get your rental 
      terminated with no refund.</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font color="#EDDF94" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Scripts 
      - Please keep scripts to a minimum. The Ferndale owners reserve the right 
      to return any item that is script heavy and affecting the sim. This includes 
      scripts that you wear on your person. Business owners are encouraged to 
      us low memory vendor script to encourage a lag free sim. Single vendors 
      with one script functions are the best.</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font color="#EDDF94" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Media 
      - The parcel uses theme-appropriate music and media that can not be changed 
      by renters. If we have enough requests, we can change the streams and/or 
      media. Feel free to make suggestions. Note that the stream will be changed 
      to individual performer's streams on the night of live entertainment at 
      Jack's Nightclub.</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font color="#EDDF94" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Neighbors 
      - Please be courteous of your neighbors. This is a beautiful sim and we 
      attract nice people who appreciate fine living in a lag-free and privacy 
      initiated sim. As in real life, please show each other respect. If you choose 
      to use a security system, do not set the range to anything over 10m. This 
      will encroach on your neighbors property if set higher. Also, please make 
      sure you are not encroaching your prims into other business space. No use 
      of poofers, particle emitters, or large prims that traverse into another 
      person's property please. Keep displays on the sidewalks in front of your 
      store to a minimum. (Nothing on the streets please!)</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font color="#EDDF94" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Adult 
      Activities (sex) - Since these are private residences on a mature/moderate 
      sim adult activities are allowed INSIDE only. Public adult activities are 
      not allowed. Any activity involving age play (children avatars, etc.) will 
      not be tolerated. This is against the SL terms of service. You will be banned 
      and reported to SL immediately.</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font color="#EDDF94" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Renewing 
      - If you choose not to renew rent, please let Zoltan Mint know a week in 
      advance if possible. We have a waiting list or folks trying to get your 
      spot! If you do not pay your rent within 24 hours of the due date, you will 
      be ejected from the group and your items returned.</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font color="#EDDF94" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Griefing 
      - Anything deemed griefing is strictly prohibited. This includes weapons, 
      griefer HUDS, caging, spying on neighbors, trespassing on neighbors property, 
      harassing in chat or IM and the like. If you are caught or reported for 
      griefing, you will be banned and not refunded.</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font color="#EDDF94" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">We 
      thank you for joining our family of renters in Ferndale. Please explore 
      the parcel and you will find everything you need in SL is right here! Enjoy 
      your stay!!</font></b></p>
