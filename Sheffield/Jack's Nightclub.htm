      The dance ball is near the ceiling on the ground floor. This is a state-of-the-art 
      dance ball that contains couples dance animations. You can choose many different 
      dance styles from sub-menus that will appear on your screen when you click 
      on the ball. You will need to accept the animation request and turn your 
      AO (Animation Over-ride) off for the dances to run smoothly. Also, please 
      be patient, SL lag may slow the animations from getting to you.</font></b></p>

      For single dances, use the Dance Machine on the wall near the front entrance. 
      Select from the blue male or pink female dancer in the picture. There are 
      many cool dances inside that span all the dance styles out there. Say &quot;yes&quot; 
      when the machine asks to animate your avatar, and turn off your AO.</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font color="#EDDF94" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">15) 
      Feeling Lucky? Jack's has a &quot;splodder&quot; near the ceiling on the 
      ground floor. Just left click on it and pay the amount you want to gamble. 
      (Minimum of 10 L). The more you pay, the better your chances of winning 
      a bigger pot. The splodder needs 5 people to play. As soon as 5 have paid, 
      it will count downs and explode with money! Everyone who plays will receive 
      something. Try it! Its a blast!</font></b></p>

      events. We have many colored lights, smoke, fireworks, explosions, and fire 
      during live shows!</font></b></p>

      YOUR STREAM<br>
      We do not use a Shoutcast board. Because things change so often in SL, (namely 
      your streams), we found it easier to just add your stream manually. We have 
      your current stream in your profile notes. So if it changes, just let us 
      know. On show night, we will plug your stream in 1-5 minutes before the 
      show. Please make sure your stream is working properly and you are broadcasting 
      from your end. You may plug your stream in yourself if a Manager is not 
      available. </font></b></p>

      YOUR TIP BOARD (And other props)<br>
      We recommend that you rez your tip board and other props on the ground next 
      to the stage, or at least on the edge of the stage. The reason is, our stage 
      has nicely designed lighting effects, and those lights have &quot;prim beams.&quot; 
      These beams may slightly interfere with guests trying to click on your items. 
      Generally, if they zoom in on your props, there is no problem. This is not 
      a big issue, just something to be aware of if you have lots of rezzed items. 
      Oh yeah, the microphone on stage can be lowered by clicking its base and 
      raised by clicking the mic piece. Adjust it to your avi's height appropriately.</font></b></p>

      10,000 members.</font></b></p>

    <p><b><font color="#EDDF94" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">YOUR 
      LIGHTS<br>
      Someone will be running lights and effects on the stage for you. Don't worry, 
      these lights are very professional and subtle and will add entertainment 
      value to the show. If you have any special request - like songs that you 
      want smoke, fire or explosions, please tell us in advance. Otherwise, we 
      will do our best to make them awesome.</font></b></p>

      please finish a few minutes early, including cleaning up your rezzed props.

      for you, listed your show in LL's Events, and scheduled your show on our

      Why Jack's Nightclub Does Not Pay Performers</b></font></p>
    <p><b><font color="#EDDF94" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As 
      many of you know, we have consciously made the decision to not offer lindens 
      to entertainers who perform at Jack's Nightclub. Please understand that 
      this decision was made after 3 years of experience while keeping Jack's 
      Nightclub open in Second Life. Also we have had many conversations with 
      other performance venue owners, and many chats with live performers in Second 
      Life, including full time professionals, and casual new entertainers. Please 
      understand that this is not meant as an insult or to question anyone's skill 
      as a performer. It is simply our decision on how we need to do business 
      in SL. In the light of this, here is why we made this decision.</font></b></p>
    <p><font size="2" color="#EDDF94" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>The 
      first and biggest reason is that venues suffer the biggest blow in costs. 
      Venue owners must pay extravagant tier costs weekly. The average rent is 
      around 5500 lindens a week for a 1/4 sized parcel. Then there is the cost 
      of the buildings, gadgets, furniture, and other amenities that make the 
      place attractive and inviting. Plus we at Jack's Nightclub spend close to 
      200L per show on advertising each performer's show, to attract fans and 
      get the word out to the entire grid. Throw in other incidental costs, and 
      you have a very expensive endeavor to produce every night of the week.</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2" color="#EDDF94" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>A 
      performer has expenses too, and we realize this. However, it is no where 
      near the expense a venue owner has. Spending the one time cost for instrument 
      prims, getting a publicity photo, and paying for the competitively low priced 
      music streams are minimal. These expenditures can be matched in a single 
      show with tips. A venue owner must pay the weekly tier or will be forced 
      to close down. And we all know that happens way too often with venues in 
      Second Life.</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2" color="#EDDF94" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>We 
      also understand that most performers are professional and worthy of venue 
      payment. Unfortunately, most performers are not doing the math correctly. 
      If we were to pay all our performers 5000L each, for each show (5000L seems 
      to be the average asking price for experienced singers), then we would be 
      shilling out over 70,000L a week for entertainers. That is over $300 a week 
      in real life cash. That is much more than tickets for a national touring 
      band! Add the other costs and you will quickly see that it simply is not 
      a reasonable business practice, at least for us. I know of no entertainment 
      venue that could stay open very long with those costs.</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2" color="#EDDF94" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>If 
      you are a performer demanding venue pay - ask yourself this. If 5000L (or 
      less) is that important to you in Second Life, why not play out in the real 
      world and get more money? After all, 5000L is around $20. Certainly, you 
      will make more in the real world. Why not use Second Life to reach new fans, 
      network with other musicians and promoters, practice your craft, and just 
      have fun? Remember fun? That was what Second Life was created for!</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2" color="#EDDF94" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Second 
      reason we don't pay - your fans should be the ones supporting you, not venues 
      that give you the forum to perform in. That is a hard pill to swallow, but 
      true. Grow your fan base by being professional, polite, entertaining and 
      talented. They will come to see you play, and often. You should have a fan 
      group with no less than 200 people. Send notifications out for every show. 
      Your fans will follow you, tip you, and you will certainly make enough money 
      to cover your expenses. On average, the bigger performers that play at Jack's 
      Nightclub make between 1000 and 5000L in tips anyway. That is the true test 
      of popularity - having fans support your endeavor on Second Life. By the 
      way, many large venues in real life are paid by the performers to rent the 
      hall. &quot;Four walling&quot; in Vegas is now the norm for most entertainers. 
      Why then, should it be different in Second Life?</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2" color="#EDDF94" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Finally, 
      we at Jacks Nightclub truly love singers, musicians and other types of live 
      entertainment. We are respectful and polite to all our performers. Most 
      become good friends. There is a reason we are a Linden Lab's Editor Pick 
      for 3 years in a row. There is a reason that Jack's Nightclub is frequently 
      &quot;trending&quot; on the forums. There is a reason why most big, professional 
      acts PAY US, after their performance. It is because we understand that music, 
      and all entertainment on Second Life should be fun, exciting, and entertaining. 
      If it becomes a question of money demands, then venues will continue to 
      just disappear and performers will struggle to find places that are open 
      and accepting live acts.</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2" color="#EDDF94" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>I 
      am a live performer in Second Life. I have purchased thousands of lindens 
      worth of props. I have spent hours writing jokes and scripts. After 3 years, 
      I still do not require the venues to pay me. Tips are just fine. And I am 
      having a blast!</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="2" color="#EDDF94" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Re-look 
      your needs. How about doing what you love with less desire for gain? You 
      may just find yourself with a huge following, filled up gig calendars, and 
      friends with some true, honest, and respectful people.</b></font></p>
