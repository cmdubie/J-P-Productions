      want to play. (Only General #1 will appear in new games.) You can change 
      the subject as often as you wish. You may want to add expansion Subject 
      Cards in the future. When you add them to you game device, they will show 
      up in your menu too. You can create your own cards, or purchase pre-made 
      cards and card sets from Minty Good Games.</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font color="#EDDF94" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">After 
      the subject is agreed upon, players may take turns right clicking on feather 
      quill. Every time someone clicks on the feather, they will be given a starting 
      line of a poem. They now need to add their line, hopefully rhyming with 
      the given line. There is no score keeping, or winners in this game. You 
      simply have fun adding your line of poetry. There are many ways of playing 
      and styles of poetry that can be used. (Maybe players agree on Prose, instead 
      of Rhyme?) Everyone should give their line after the first player's line, 
      again, rhyming with the device given line. A lot of laughs can be had as 
      players add their silly or serious lines to the growing poem!</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font color="#EDDF94" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Try 
      to keep to the beat of the poem too, if possible. Perhaps you can get double 
      &quot;points&quot; for rhyming multiple words within the same line! If the 
      Owner wants to award points, he or she can, which may lead to the &quot;Best 
      Poet&quot; award!</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font color="#EDDF94" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Play 
      continues until all players are finished taking turns. There really is no 
      &quot;end&quot; to the game. Poem lines are drawn in order, so there should 
      not be any repeats during a game. Be creative! Have fun!</font></b></p>
