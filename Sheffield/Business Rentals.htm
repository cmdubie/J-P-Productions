      Mint or any representative of Sheffield Estates, you are accepting the terms

      You may pay for at least one week's rent or up to 4 weeks rent in advance. 
      If someone other than yourself pays the rent, you will have to contact Zoltan 
      Mint for clarification.</b></font></p>

      to have the ability to rezz and obtain a prim counter. Please IM Zoltan 
      Mint upon renting. Please be aware that I am not online 24 hours a day. 
      My messages are forwarded to my E-mail. You will be added within 24 hours.</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#EDDF94"><b>Theme 
      - Sheffield is a small sea port town, catering to folks interested in the 
      Victorian, Steampunk, and Gas Light role playing eras. Sheffield welcomes 
      visitors, business owners, gamers, fun seekers, and everyone to explore 
      this cool place! Sheffield consists of a limited number of rent buildings. 
      We do not offer parcels or land, but instead, we offer pre-fab building 
      spaces. You are not allowed to rez your own house, or any large structure 
      on the desired space. If you do, it will be returned to you with in 24 hours. 
      Each building will have different set prim allotments. You may rez furniture 
      and/or business items as you see fit, but please try to keep your rezzed 
      items to as close as the theme as possible. (1900's - 1940's.) Ugly, garish 
      items, either in your yard, business, and/or extended from your house will 
      get a warning for removal. Please do not attempt to alter or delete any 
      prefab prim items already existing in your rental parcel.</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#EDDF94"><b>Permissible 
      Products - Feel free to sell anything inside the buildings you are renting. 
      However, Please do not sell any of the following items; griefing items or 
      other things that can cause harm to sims, other avatars, or prims. Also, 
      please no sex related items that contain under age persons, either real 
      life or Second Life in nature. If you are selling sexually explicit material, 
      please be tasteful and do not rez out pictures of sexual acts, either real 
      or pixel. Please try to keep to the them of this parcel - 1900's - 1940's 
      in both products and decorations. Thank you.</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#EDDF94"><b>About 
      Vendors - You only have 50 prims to display your wares. Our recommendation 
      is to use the available ONE PRIM vendors that are found on Marketplace or 
      in shops in-world. Try to find low prim displays and vendors that are running 
      1-2 scripts. There are many and inexpensive too.</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#EDDF94"><b>Lag 
      - To keep this sim as a low-lag sim, please keep your business locations 
      to 20 people per business, per hour. When lag becomes unusually severe, 
      we will res-set the sim, so be prepared to move to another location when 
      this occurs. Re-sets last approximately 2 minutes.</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#EDDF94"><b>Prims 
      - Please do not go over your allotted prim limit. To check how many prims 
      you have rezzed, please check your prim box, which will keep track of everything 
      you bring into the parcel.(The prim box is the small green box under your 
      rent box.) If you go over your prim limit, you will be warned. If you do 
      not reduce the prim count within 24 hours, the Sheffield owners will return 
      items to you that they see fit. MAKE SURE YOU ARE WEARING THE GROUP TAG 
      WHEN REZZING! Anything rezzed under the wrong tag will be returned after 
      5 minutes. Continuous problems with the above will get your rental terminated 
      with no refund.</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#EDDF94"><b>Scripts 
      - Please keep scripts to a minimum. The Sheffield owners reserve the right 
      to return any item that is script heavy and affecting the sim. This includes 
      scripts that you wear on your person. Business owners are encouraged to 
      us low memory vendor script to encourage a lag free sim. Single vendors 
      with one script functions are the best.</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#EDDF94"><b>Media 
      - The parcel uses theme-appropriate music and media that can not be changed 
      by renters. If we have enough requests, we can change the streams and/or 
      media. Feel free to make suggestions. Note that the stream will be changed 
      to individual performer's streams on the night of live entertainment at 
      Jack's Nightclub.</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#EDDF94"><b>Neighbors 
      - Please be courteous of your neighbors. This is a beautiful sim and we 
      attract high-end clientele that appreciate fine living in a lag-free and 
      privacy initiated sim. As in real life, please show each other respect. 
      If you choose to use a security system, do not set the range to anything 
      over 10 meters. This will encroach on your neighbors property if set higher. 
      Also, please make sure you are not encroaching your prims into other business 
      space. No use of poofers, particle emitters, or large prims that traverse 
      into another person's property please. Keep displays on the sidewalks in 
      front of your store to a minimum. You may rez on the sidewalks, But nothing 
      on the streets please!</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#EDDF94"><b>Adult 
      Activities (sex) - Since these are private businesses on a mature/moderate 
      sim adult activities are allowed INSIDE only. Public adult activities are 
      not allowed. Any activity involving age play (children avatars, etc.) will 
      not be tolerated. This is against the SL terms of service. You will be banned 
      and reported to SL immediately.</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#EDDF94"><b>Renewing 
      - If you choose not to renew rent, please let Zoltan Mint know a week in 
      advance if possible. We have a waiting list or folks trying to get your 
      spot! If you do not pay your rent within 24 hours of the due date, you will 
      be ejected from the group and your items returned.</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#EDDF94"><b>Griefing 
      - Anything deemed griefing is strictly prohibited. This includes weapons, 
      griefer HUDS, caging, spying on neighbors, trespassing on neighbors property, 
      harassing in chat or IM and the like. If you are caught or reported for 
      griefing, you will be banned and not refunded.</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#EDDF94"><b>We 
      thank you for joining our family of renters in Sheffield. Please explore 
      the parcel and you will find everything you need in SL is right here! Enjoy 
      your stay!!</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#EDDF94"><b>Please 
      contact Zoltan Mint with any additional questions.</b></font></p>
