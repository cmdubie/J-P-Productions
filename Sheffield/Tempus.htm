    <p><font color="#EDDF94" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Welcome 
      to the Tempus Space Station! Here you will find everything you need to work, 
      live and play in deep space! The Tempus is a huge place, with many levels 
      and decks. It is so big, in fact, that you may get lost quickly. Let the 
      following be your guide, and hopefully you can explore all the locations 
      within the space station and have a great visit!</b></font></p>
    <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#EDDF94">Note 
      - To get around to all of the location listed below, use the highly advanced 
      transport tube that you will find on each level. To use the transporter, 
      just left click on the white circle in the transporter and a menu of locations 
      will appear. Use this menu and click the corresponding button to the location 
      you wish to travel to. Wait till the white floor turns green, then left 
      click the green area and you will immediately teleport to your new destination.</font></b></p>
    <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#FFFFFF"><b>COMMAND 
      CENTER</b></font><br>
      <font color="#EDDF94" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>This 
      is the heart of the space station. Here you will find controls for the communication 
      systems, alert systems, navigation, main controls, and even an artificial 
      intelligence named &quot;Isis.&quot; The captain of the ship commands all 
      operations from this location.<br>
      Note - most of the controls are limited to Captains or crew that are wearing 
      the &quot;Mint Entertainment&quot; tag.</b></font></p>
    <p><font color="#EDDF94" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b><font color="#FFFFFF">AIRLOCKS</font><br>
      This controlled area will open a door to open space. Used primarily to vent 
      junk, it could be used to extract enemies. The control station here will 
      open or close both doors.</b></font></p>
    <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#FFFFFF">AUXILIARY</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#EDDF94"><br>
      These small levels are mostly used for storage. Most station supplies are 
      brought and cataloged here. These areas are sometimes used for small meetings 
      and training.</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#FFFFFF">DOCKING 
      BAY AND DOCKING ARM</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#EDDF94"><br>
      This level contains the large ship docking arm and controls. The arm can 
      adapt to any ship that wishes to dock at the Tempus. There are two control 
      stations - one on the docking bay level, and a second near the end of the 
      docking arm.</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#FFFFFF">ENGINE 
      ROOM</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#EDDF94"><br>
      This area consists of three levels that surround the engine core. They are 
      primarily used by engineering only and are dangerous places for the casual 
      visitor.</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#FFFFFF"><img src="ShuttleBay.jpg" width="307" height="218" align="left">HANGER</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#EDDF94"><br>
      This large space is used to house the smaller ships like the transports 
      and fighters. A large door with a force field allows ships to come and go 
      as needed. Inside you will find several ships to fly. You will have to get 
      Zoltan Mint to &quot;unlock&quot; them for you. Once unlocked, you left 
      click them and &quot;pilot&quot; or sit in them. You can then fly them around 
      space - either for fun or for dogfights!</font></b></p>

    <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#FFFFFF">LANDING 
      PADS</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#EDDF94"><br>
      Three landing pads provide areas where small to medium ships can land and 
      lock down. A center elevator allows space travelers to safely rise out onto 
      the pads.</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#FFFFFF">LEVEL 
      ONE</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#EDDF94"><br>
      This is the largest and most busiest level on the space station. This area 
      contains all the day-to-day operation rooms to keep the station running. 
      You will find the following areas (most of which are restricted) on Level 
      One:<br>
      <br>
      Main Concourse - A huge space viewing area and running track.<br>
      The Head - Bathrooms and public showers.<br>
      The Infirmary - Emergancy treatment and hospital.<br>
      Meeting Room - Three tables and remote control centers.<br>
      Weapons/Armor Supply - lockers full of weapons and space armor.<br>
      Military Bunks - This large facility houses the station's men at arms.<br>
      Cryo-Chamber - This area is for long term travel - sleep chambers for any 
      length of time.<br>
      Astrophysics - This small area is where courses are plotted and the Main 
      Frame is monitored.</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#FFFFFF">LEVEL 
      TWO</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#EDDF94"><br>
      This level mostly consists of suites for the officers and guests. Also, 
      electronic and engineering have workrooms on this level. Access to the station's 
      service conduits are available on this level.</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#FFFFFF">OBSERVATORY</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3" color="#EDDF94"><br>
      This level is for fun and relaxation. Travelers and crew will find a dance 
      club here, as well as a bar and replicator for food and drink. There is 
      a small cafe and electronic games that are free to use and play. Also, the 
      wide windows allows the best view of space!</font></b></p>
