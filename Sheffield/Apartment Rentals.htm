      The Sheffield Apartments are small efficiency living spaces that are suitable 
      for up to two people. Each apartment is fully furnished and you can temporarily 
      rez boxes and other small items. Each apartment has its own teleporter and 
      each apartment's walls can be changed via an easy to use texture changer 
      that exist near the front door. There is also an </b></font><font color="#EDDF94" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4"><b>

    <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="4" color="#EDDF94">Each 
      apartment comes furnished with a modifiable living room set that you can 
      add or subtract parts. You can also change the color and the chairs have 
      multiple animations for singles and couples. You also receive a dining room 
      set that you can change wood and table cloth color. We include a bookshelf 
      that contains many books that you can actually read via delivered note cards 
      Finally, we include a very good bed that can be texture changed as well. 
      The bed contains over 500 animations for couples, singles, and more!</font></b></p>

      apartments are both themed for Sheffield's 1930's era, but yet modern enough

      Rules and Regulations For Apartment Renters<br>
      </b></font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#EDDF94"><b>Please 
      read these basic rules. Failure to do so may result in terminating your 
      rental with no refund. By renting from Zoltan Mint or any representative 
      of Sheffield Estates, you are accepting the terms of this agreement.</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#EDDF94"><b>Liability 
      Waiver - As a renter and/or visitor of Sheffield Estate properties, you 
      agree not to hold Zoltan Mint and/or any representative of Sheffield Estates, 
      liable for any loss or damage to any or all rezzed items/prims that may 
      occur beyond their control. This covenant is updated regularly, and the 
      most current version will supersede any previous versions.</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#EDDF94"><b>Payment 
      - You are required and expected to pay your rent on time, weekly. Please 
      pay the individual Apartment rent box. (The one on the porch of the floor 
      you desire.) You will receive an IMl when your rent becomes due 24 hours 
      in advance. If you are later than 24 hours paying late rent, you will be 
      evicted. You may pay for at least one week's rent or up to 4 weeks rent 
      in advance. If someone other than your or your living companion pays the 
      rent, you will have to contact Zoltan Mint for clarification.</b></font></p>

      Rent for a Sheffield Apartment = <font color="#FFFFFF">150 lindens a week.</font></b></font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#EDDF94"><b>Group 
      Tag - Upon renting, you will be invited to the Sheffield Estate Group to 
      have the ability to rezz. Please IM Zoltan Mint upon renting. Please be 
      aware that I am not online 24 hours a day. My messages are forwarded to 
      my E-mail. You will be added within 24 hours.</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#EDDF94"><b>Theme 
      - Sheffield is a small sea port town, catering to folks interested in the 
      Victorian, Steampunk, and Gas Light role playing eras. Sheffield welcomes 
      visitors, business owners, gamers, fun seekers, and everyone to explore 
      this cool place! Sheffield consists of a limited number of rent buildings. 
      We do not offer parcels or land, but instead, we offer pre-fab building 
      spaces. Please do not attempt to alter or delete any prefab prim items already 
      existing in your rental parcel.</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#EDDF94"><b>Lag 
      - To keep this sim as a low-lag sim, please keep your guest count in private 
      homes to less than 5 avatars. When lag becomes unusually severe, we will 
      res-set the sim, so be prepared to move to another location. Re-sets last 
      approximately 2 minutes.</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#EDDF94"><b>Scripts 
      - Please keep scripts to a minimum. The Sheffield owners reserve the right 
      to return any item that is script heavy and affecting the sim. This includes 
      scripts that you wear on your person. We don not recommend rezzing high 
      scripted items like pets.</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#EDDF94"><b>Media 
      - The parcel uses theme-appropriate music and media that can not be changed 
      by renters. If we have enough requests, we can change the streams and/or 
      media. Feel free to make suggestions. Note that the stream will be changed 
      to individual performer's streams on the night of live entertainment at 
      Jack's Nightclub.</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#EDDF94"><b>Guests 
      - Upon renting you can have one other person added to the group to rezz 
      and live on your rented property. Their prims count towards your total prim 
      limit. If you need more than one person added, please IM Zoltan Mint. It 
      is to his discretion, and it is not guaranteed. This sim is rezz enabled 
      with a 5 minute return limit. So if you just need someone to rezz purchases 
      to unpack, they can without the group tag. You are responsible for your 
      guests actions. Please explain to your guest that they too, will need to 
      wear their group tag while rezzing on this sim.</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#EDDF94"><b>Neighbors 
      - Please be courteous of your neighbors. This is a beautiful sim and we 
      attract high-end clientele that appreciate fine living in a lag-free and 
      privacy initiated sim. As in real life, please show each other respect. 
      If you choose to use a security system, do not set the range to anything 
      over 10 meters. This will encroach on your neighbors property if set higher. 
      Also, please make sure you are not encroaching your prims into other apartment 
      dweller's space. No use of poofers, particle emitters, or large prims that 
      traverse into another person's property please.</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#EDDF94"><b>Adult 
      Activities (sex) - Since these are private residences on a mature/moderate 
      sim adult activities are allowed INSIDE only. Public adult activities are 
      not allowed. Any activity involving age play (children avatars, etc.) will 
      not be tolerated. This is against the SL terms of service. You will be banned 
      and reported to SL immediately.</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#EDDF94"><b>Renewing 
      - If you choose not to renew rent, please let Zoltan Mint know a week in 
      advance if possible. We have a waiting list or folks trying to get your 
      spot! If you do not pay your rent within 24 hours of the due date, you will 
      be ejected from the group and your items returned.</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#EDDF94"><b>Griefing 
      - Anything deemed griefing is strictly prohibited. This includes weapons, 
      griefer HUDS, caging, spying on neighbors, trespassing on neighbors property, 
      harassing in chat or IM and the like. If you are caught or reported for 
      griefing, you will be banned and not refunded.</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#EDDF94"><b>We 
      thank you for joining our family of renters in Sheffield. Please explore 
      the parcel and you will find everything you need in SL is right here! Enjoy 
      your stay!!</b></font></p>
    <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#EDDF94"><b>Please 
      contact Zoltan Mint with any additional questions.</b></font></p>
