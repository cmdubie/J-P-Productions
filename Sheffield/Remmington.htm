      Helpful Hints</b></font></p>
    <p><b><font color="#EDDF94" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">To 
      obtain optimum satisfaction from this adventure, please execute the following 
      hints:</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font color="#EDDF94" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">1) 
      Turn your day setting to Midnight! A haunted house is far more atmospheric 
      at night!</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font color="#EDDF94" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">2) 
      Turn off the Sim music.There is subtle music and sound cues at the location 
      that can not be heard if you have your media on. So turn up your volume 
      and turn off the music!</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font color="#EDDF94" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">3) 
      Many areas will require you to use Mouselook. (View/Mouselook) This will 
      help you navigate in tight spots. We highly recommend Mouselook for the 
      whole adventure. And don't cheat by camming through walls! Take one room 
      at a time!</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font color="#EDDF94" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">4) 
      Click on everything you see in the Mansion! Click on items to receive note 
      cards. Click on objects to interact with them as well. (You can sit on chairs, 
      lay on beds, open doors, etc...) Some events are &quot;triggered&quot; when 
      you get close enough to them, so stay there a bit and wait for the scene 
      to &quot;rez.&quot; Some objects will give you a sound too. Pretty creepy 
      stuff.</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font color="#EDDF94" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">5) 
      Read ALL note cards that are offered to you. When they pop up on your screen, 
      read them from start to finish. It is there the mystery will unravel. You 
      will find valuable clues, a few &quot;MacGuffins,&quot; and a few &quot;Red 
      Herrings&quot; too!</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font color="#EDDF94" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">6) 
      You may want to stay in each defined area for awhile. The reason for this 
      is some things will rez slower than others. You may miss some cool effects 
      or a subtle clue because Second Life's lag is taking its good old time rezzing 
      something here. Give it a minute and watch the room closely.</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font color="#EDDF94" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">7) 
      When you are done investigating the house, return here. You will see a &quot;Mystery 
      Answer Board&quot; sitting here. Leave it alone for now - do not click it 
      or your mystery will be over! (Sorry, the sign can not take back your &quot;click!&quot;) 
      After you have explored the house and solved the crime, come back to the 
      board and select your answer. You will see 6 potential perpetrator's names 
      on the board. Select one and only one! If you are right, you will receive 
      a prize box! If you chose poorly, you will receive nothing and can not select 
      again. So think carefully about your answer. If you are with a group, one 
      person should answer only. Everyone should share their facts, and one &quot;detective&quot; 
      click the box. The prize can be shared by the winner anyway, it will be 
      transferable.</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font color="#EDDF94" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">8) 
      Pay attention to the details. This attraction has been carefully created 
      with many details that include rich textures, hidden clues, and mini-scenes 
      with plot offering vignettes. Don't just &quot;romp&quot; through the house. 
      There is no particular order to solve the mystery, but the more clues you 
      gather, the easier it will be to solve the crime.</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font color="#EDDF94" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">9) 
      Please tell your friends and contacts about this place! Invite them to solve 
      the mystery with you! It is actually a great night of fun and intrigue for 
      a group of friends! Who will solve the mystery first?</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font color="#EDDF94" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">10) 
      Please tip the tip box near the front sign if you enjoyed yourself! We have 
      to pay tier here and your help will keep this attraction open! Any donations 
      are appreciated!</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font color="#EDDF94" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">We

    <p><b><font color="#EDDF94" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">On 
      that note, let us start your evening off with this...</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font color="#EDDF94" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">&quot;It 
      was a hot and dark summer night in Boston, Massachusetts on that fateful 
      night in 1820. The Remmington family had just gathered in the living room 
      for some reading and relaxation. Mr. Remmington , smoking his pipe, watched 
      his two children playing with their wooden toys on the floor. Mrs. Remmington, 
      laying on the divan, was entering notes into her beloved diary...&quot;</font></b></p>
