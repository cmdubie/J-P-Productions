    To Get On The Grid:</b></font></h1>
  <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="5" color="#FFFFFF">- You 
    need a viewer to log into the virtual grid. We recommend this viewer: <a href="http://www.firestormviewer.org/downloads/">Firestorm.</a> 
    Download and install it to your PC. It is free and safe. Be sure to DL the 
    appropriate version for your system. The most common version is the &quot;For 
    SL &amp; Opensim 64 bit&quot;</font></b></p>
  <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="5" color="#FFFFFF">- Create 
    an account on the Virtual Highway grid. Here is the web page to do that: <a href="http://virtualhighway.us/vhweb/">Virtual 
    Highway.</a> Follow the instructions there to create an avatar and select 
    a name. An e-mail verification will finish this short process. If you have 
    any issues during this process, contact the &quot;live support,&quot; available 
    on the web page.</font></b></p>
  <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="5" color="#FFFFFF">- To 
    allow your viewer to access the Virtual Highway grid, you need to tell the 
    viewer to include Virtual Highway. Go here for instructions on how to to this: 
    <a href="http://virtualhighway.us/vhweb/viewer-instructions/">VH on Firestorm.</a> 
    (Scroll down to the Firestorm instructions.)</font></b></p>
  <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="5" color="#FFFFFF">- We 
    recommend the &quot;Phoenix&quot; skin, available in the lower right corner 
    of the viewer's log in screen, under the drop down menu there.</font></b></p>
  <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="5" color="#FFFFFF">- Log 
    in to Virtual Highway! Using the viewer, enter your avatar's name and password 
    and log into the grid. You will start at the welcome landing and are free 
    to explore that area and get used to moving around. (See below.)</font></b></p>

  <h1><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="6" color="#00CCFF"><b>What 
    To Do Once Your Are In-World:</b></font></h1>
  <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="5" color="#FFFFFF">- You 
    can adjust your preferences in the Firestorm viewer any way you wish. (Under 
    the drop down menu at the top of your viewer - &quot;Avatar/Preferences.&quot;) 
    Learn how to walk, run, fly and generally move around in the 3D environment. 
    Learn how to use your camera controls to pan around and view things. (Avatar/Camera 
    Controls.) Find your inventory and get a good idea on how things work there.

    tab, then &quot;Send Message.&quot;) Let him know you have arrived. If he 
    is on-line, he will help you navigate and get involved in the role playing 
    areas of the grid. If he is not on-line, send him a message and he will receive 
    it in his e-mail and get back to you shortly.</font></b></p>
  <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="5" color="#FFFFFF">- We 
    will help you find a more appropriate avatar, role play outfits, equipment, 
    weapons, etc.. for what ever game you want to play. We will take you to the

  <h1><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="6" color="#00CCFF"><b>What 
    You Need to Role Play Virtually:</b></font></h1>
  <p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="5" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>- You 
    need your own rule system. You can play any role play game you want here! 
    We have areas designed for such classic role play games like Dungeons &amp; 
    Dragons, Shadowrun, Star Wars, Star Trek, Deadlands, Pathfinder, Call of Cthulhu, 
    Traveller, Cyberpunk, Vampire, Champions, Rifts, Middle Earth, and many, many 
    more! The game rooms have links to many rule systems that you can use, should 
    you choose to run a game in Virtual Highway.</b></font></p>
  <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="5" color="#FFFFFF">- You 
    need to visit the Game Hub. There, you will find links to 100's of encounter 
    areas, ready for your use to role play in! These areas are generic enough 
    that you can use them for what ever setting you desire. You will find old 
    west towns, fantasy dungeons, Victorian horror locations, sci-fi space stations, 
    and many other locals, just waiting for you to explore! We have even recreated 
    some of the classic D&amp;D adventures in 3D for you convenience. Ask the 
    staff to give you links to these ultra cool adventure locations!</font></b></p>
  <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="5" color="#FFFFFF">- A 
    newer computer with a good graphic card is highly recommended. Virtual gaming 
    is a bit demanding on processors, so be sure to upgrade your equipment to 
    experience the best possible experience.</font></b></p>
  <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="5" color="#FFFFFF">- You 
    will need a reliable Internet connection. We recommend using a directly connected 
    ethernet cable, and not Wifi. Wifi is possible, but you may experience voice 
    issues in-world. The faster your modem, the better.</font></b></p>
  <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="5" color="#FFFFFF">- You 
    will need a working microphone and speakers attached to your PC. These can 
    be purchased cheaply either on the Internet or at your local electronic stores. 
    Being able to speak to fellow players is necessary for a smooth role playing 
    experience. We recommend a headset that has both ear speakers and microphone 
    built in.</font></b></p>
  <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="5" color="#FFFFFF">- You 
    will need a group of players. We have many people willing to jump into a game, 
    from all over the world, but we recommend that you find your own group of 
    players, and invite them into Virtual Highway. Ideas on players include people 
    you have not seen in awhile or that may have moved away. Virtual gaming is 
    awesome in the fact that you can reconnect with old friends you may have not 
    gamed with in a log while!</font></b></p>
  <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="5" color="#FFFFFF">- So 
    decide what game you want to run or play in, find a group of players, schedule 
    a regular meet up, and play role playing games with the world, sitting in 
    the comfort of your own home! For further information about the available 
    genres and adventure settings in VH, <a href="http://vhmint.ml/">click here</a>.
