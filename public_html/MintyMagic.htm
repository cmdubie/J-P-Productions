      includes rezzed out and working stage illusions, and a dash of old fashion 
      joke telling. This show is a throw-back tribute to the old burlesque, vaudeville 
      like shows of the days gone by. His show is perfect for all venues and all 
      audiences. Contact Zoltan today for booking info!</b></font></p>

      Zoltan's show is approximately 45 minutes long, and is a non - stop, fun 
      filled extravaganza! The show has rezzed magical illusions, funny humor, 
      and lots of audience participation.</b></font></p>
    <p><b><font color="#EDDF94" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Zoltan's 
      act is typed-chat based, with full audience interaction. Because of the 
      stream is needed, but if you would like to play music underneath the show, 
      that is fine. We suggest non-lyric based, or instrumental background music, 
      like jazz.</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font color="#EDDF94" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Zoltan 
      works for a minimum of 100% of show tips. You heard right! <u>Just tips</u>. 
      Of course, Zoltan appreciates tips from the venue owners if they are so 
      inclined. Never necessary, but always appreciated! :)</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font color="#EDDF94" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">The 
      show also needs approximately 80 extra open, temporary prim slots for the 
      illusions to be rezzed. Although a stage is optimal, he can work in any 
      area that offers roughly a 20m x 20m space. He will bring his own tip jars 
      and tip poster. A stage can be provided by Zoltan if there is additional 
      prim allowance.</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font color="#EDDF94" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Please 
      book early - give him at least a 1 week lead for any dates. Times and dates 
      are preferred in PDT/SLT . Zoltan can work around venue's schedule, but 
      because of a needed 30 minute of set up time, its best if he performs first 
      so not to bother other performers setting up.</font></b></p>

    <p align="left"><b><font color="#EDDF94" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Zoltan 
      has been performing magic in real life for the last 40 years. He lives near 
      Cleveland, Ohio and offers a kid's show, a close up show, and a big stage 
      comedy show for large venues. His specialty is close up magic, but that 
      does not really work in SL. So he does large illusions in SL, accompanied 
      by knee-slapping humor. He has been performing on SL since his first week 
      on! He also teaches close up magic and is an avid movie fan in real life. 
      He is older than dirt, and only slightly older than his teeth!</font></b></p>

      Mint's Magic Show is like nothing else on Second Life. He is hilarious, 
      cheeky, and has a really unique presentation style that is truly his own. 
      I couldn't imagine what magic in SL would be like, but this far exceeded 
      my expectations. Every show I've been to people love it and leave talking 
      about what a great time they had! You must experience this to believe it!

      Mint is SL's comedic hidden treasure. I cant stop with the pirate jokes. 
      You owe it to yourself to check out Zoltan's act yourself . Let him spice 
      up your night... They don't call him Mint for nothing....&quot;<br>

      <font color="#FFFFFF">&quot;A great mix of comedy and magic. Its a true 
      replication of a magic stage act. It's rare in SL to see someone put together 
      a show like this. A very original act in SL terms!&quot;<br>

    <p><b><font color="#EDDF94" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">&quot;I 
      have been to see many of Zoltan's shows and I can safely say I have never 
      been disappointed. His shows give the true meaning to entertainment. He 
      will bring a smile to your face and you will laugh out loud - it is almost 
      guaranteed.&quot;<br>

    <p><b><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">&quot;It 
      has been my pleasure to have comedian and magician, Zoltan Mint, perform 
      several times at the New Champagne Rooms in Seraph City. His clever banter 
      amuses and entices the audiences into the suspended disbelief required to 
      make a magic show viable in a world where anything can happen. I would happily 
      recommend his showmanship to anyone looking for an unusual entertainer for 
      their guests.&quot;<br>

      Mint (aka. MagicMan) is what I would call a real 'pro' in the field of entertainment 
      in SL. Not only does he present himself professionally when booking acts, 
      but each and every time I have had the pleasure of inviting him to various 
      Festival stages, the audience is enthralled with his sense of humor and 
      the original performances he creates. I will always include 'Mint Magic' 
      in my entertainment lineups as it is always a pleasure for me to see friends 
      and family members enjoy themselves!&quot;<br>
